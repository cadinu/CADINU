CADINU TOKEN was initially designed to secure the essential capital required for the establishment and expansion of our platform on the Binance Smart Chain. Our token is readily convertible into leading cryptocurrencies through PancakeSwap, CADINUSwap DEXs, Dex-Trade, CoinsBit, and Digifinex CEXs. We're actively working to secure listings on additional centralized and decentralized exchanges.

However, our vision for CADINU Token extends beyond exchange listings. We are committed to utilizing it as a native currency on our platform, facilitating seamless transactions for various services. 

Ensuring transparency and community trust, we've taken the precautionary measure of auto-locking 100% of LP tokens using the DxSale protocol for a duration of 3 years. This move solidifies our commitment to a rug-pull-free environment, as we invite you to join the #CADINU community on our journey to build a better world safely.
